# d2s3

This might have been the worst project I could have made for a joke.
Made this for Theo's "Clone t3.chat" Clonathaton in collaboration with Shreyas who made the Flutter Web version.
This one's made in C# + Blazor WebAssembly. Take these 2 as examples of how not to build a Web App in 2025.

## Getting Started

You need to sell your soul to the Microsoft Gods, also known as Beel Entrance and Satya Nutella.
Then install dotnet v9 on your machine.

Then startup both the web and server builds with one command:

```sh
$ dotnet run
```

Make sure you fill the environment variables on the server-side before you try anything.
